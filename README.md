# Convolution_Neural_Network
*	RTL implementation of a standalone ASIC for a given CNN architecture.
*	Structured convolution, max pooling, and fully connected layers of the Neural Network. 
*	Optimized the hardware to process one input every clock cycle, to augment performance with minimum possible area of chip.
